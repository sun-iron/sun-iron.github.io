### About Me

I'm a professional with deep expertise in **cloud migration and infrastructure modernization**. I began my career as a C/C++ developer specializing in multimedia and data communication, where I developed solutions based on various protocols like **RTP/RTCP, H.323, SIP, and ZigBee**. My work in this field led to products in **distance learning, video conferencing, enterprise messaging, and LBS**.

Later, I moved into the SI (System Integration) sector, where I applied cloud technologies to service and infrastructure projects. My current focus is on finding effective strategies for **successful cloud migration and efficient cloud operations**.
